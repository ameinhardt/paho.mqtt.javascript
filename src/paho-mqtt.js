// Only expose a single object name in the global namespace.
// Everything must go through this module. Global Paho module
// only has a single public function, client, which returns
// a Paho client object given connection details.

/**
 * Send and receive messages using web browsers.
 * <p>
 * This programming interface lets a JavaScript client application use the MQTT V3.1 or
 * V3.1.1 protocol to connect to an MQTT-supporting messaging server.
 *
 * The function supported includes:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Connecting to and disconnecting from a server. The server is identified by its host name and port number.
 * <li>Specifying options that relate to the communications link with the server,
 * for example the frequency of keep-alive heartbeats, and whether SSL/TLS is required.
 * <li>Subscribing to and receiving messages from MQTT Topics.
 * <li>Publishing messages to MQTT Topics.
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * The API consists of two main objects:
 * <dl>
 * <dt><b>{@link Client}</b></dt>
 * <dd>This contains methods that provide the functionality of the API,
 * including provision of callbacks that notify the application when a message
 * arrives from or is delivered to the messaging server,
 * or when the status of its connection to the messaging server changes.</dd>
 * <dt><b>{@link Message}</b></dt>
 * <dd>This encapsulates the payload of the message along with various attributes
 * associated with its delivery, in particular the destination to which it has
 * been (or is about to be) sent.</dd>
 * </dl>
 * <p>
 * The programming interface validates parameters passed to it, and will throw
 * an Error containing an error message intended for developer use, if it detects
 * an error with any parameter.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 *
 * <code><pre>
var client = new Paho.Client(location.hostname, Number(location.port), "clientId");
client.onConnectionLost = onConnectionLost;
client.onMessageArrived = onMessageArrived;
client.connect({onSuccess:onConnect});

function onConnect() {
  // Once a connection has been made, make a subscription and send a message.
  console.log("onConnect");
  client.subscribe("/World");
  var message = new Paho.Message("Hello");
  message.destinationName = "/World";
  client.send(message);
};
function onConnectionLost(responseObject) {
  if (responseObject.errorCode !== 0)
	console.log("onConnectionLost:"+responseObject.errorMessage);
};
function onMessageArrived(message) {
  console.log("onMessageArrived:"+message.payloadString);
  client.disconnect();
};
 * </pre></code>
